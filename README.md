## Project Description

The increasing frequency and severity of traffic accidents have raised significant concerns for public safety and prompted the need for advanced accident detection systems. In response to this pressing issue, this project presents a novel approach for traffic accident detection, aimed at improving road safety and reducing associated human and economic costs. Traditional LiDAR systems are undoubtedly effective in detecting objects; however, they fall short in object identification capabilities. This limitation hinders the decision-making process of vehicles, occasionally leading to impractical or unsafe responses. In the paper "Traffic Accident Detection Using Background Subtraction and CNN Encoderâ€“Transformer Decoder in Video Frames," a method for detecting traffic accidents in videos is proposed, involving background subtraction, CNN encoder (YOLOv5), and a Transformer decoder. To enhance this method, the following improvements were made: upgrading the CNN Encoder to YOLOv8, or MobileNet-SSD v3, Consider employing ConvLSTM for crash prediction. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts to enhance road safety and emergency response, offering a promising solution for timely accident detection and response to mitigate impacts of accidents on roadways.
